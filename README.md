## WD My Cloud Home CLI

Aim of that project is to implement translation layer between WD My Cloud Home Rest API (which is not documented anywhere) and fuse. Thanks to that it will be\
possible to mount WD My Cloud Home device in the same way like any other files/disks/NAS devices.

Besides that majority of the app functionality will be also available to the user in the form of CLI commands (based on cobra library)
